Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is the use of structured methodologies and tools to create  reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions.
Software engineering is crucial in the technology industry as it enables the building of reliable and scalable solution which assist in improving efficiency and productivity within a production environment. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering was in 1968 when it was officially recognized as a discipline.
The next milestone is the rise of software development methodologies in the 1970s to improve efficiency and reliability.
The third milestone happened in the 2000s when DevOps, cloud computing, and AI came into play.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning-defining scope and objectives
Requirement analysis- the process of creating software specification documents.
System Design -this is where you define the  system architecture and the software components
Code/development-involve writing the actual code to meet the software objectives
Testing and Deployement-this involves testing the software and deploying it to a production environment.
Support- post-deployment interaction that involves fixing bugs and improving on other functionalities.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall model employs sequential and linear processes in software development and can be used in developing government solutions like a tax filing system. Agile methodology on the other hand uses iterative and flexible processes during software development and can be used in a scenario like when developing an app to order food online.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The software developer is responsible for designing, coding, and managing software applications, The quality assurance manager makes sure that the software meets quality standards before deployment in a production environment, A project manager oversees the whole process of software development and ensures the software is deployed as per the expected time.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs ensure code writing efficiency by making available features like code completion, syntax, and error detection when writing code. eg visual studio code
Version control systems track and manage any alteration in the source code making it easier for developers to collaborate. e.g GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with emerging technologies- this can be overcome by continuous learning of new technology.
Software bugs-software engineers can use debugging tools to assist in the quick identification of errors occurring within a code.
Security threats- use of encryption and authentication to secure software information,

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- this involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation to verify that they work as expected. it assists developers in identifying bugs early in the development cycle.
Integration testing is responsible for checking whether modules of a system work together correctly when combined. it assists in detecting issues in data flow, API calls, and communication between components.
System testing- this evaluates the entire software to ascertain that it meets the functional and non-functional requirements. It helps ensure that the entire system is working as expected.
Acceptance testing- this determines whether the software meets business and user requirements. its major importance is that it ensures that the software to be deployed aligns with the client's expectations.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing text instructions to AI models in order to improve their response. The most crucial importance of prompt engineering is that it enhances response quality.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Define the importance of engineering.
Define the importance of software engineering in developing new economies. 
The improved prompt is specific to a discipline and how it affects a specific niche compared to the first prompt which was too abstract.
